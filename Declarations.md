# Declarations

## Class Declarations

* The following class modifiers:
    * Access modifiers: `public`, `protected`, `private`
    * Non-access class modifiers: `abstract`, `final` , `static`, `sealed` and `non-sealed`
    * Any class it extends using the `extends` clause
    * Any interfaces it `implements` using the implements clause
* **_static code in a class can only refer to other static members in the class, whereas non-static code can refer to any member of the class._**
## Method Declarations
* The following method modifiers:
  * Access modifiers: `public`, `protected`, `private`
  * Non-access method modifiers: `static`, `abstract`, `final` and `synchronized`
  * The type of the return value, or void if the method does not return any value
  * A non-void method must either use a return statement to return a value or throw an exception to terminate its execution.
  *  It is recommended to use the `@param` tag in a Javadoc comment to document the formal parameters of a method.
  * The type in the parameter declaration cannot be designated by the var reserved type name. At compile time, it is not possible to determine the type of formal parameter.
